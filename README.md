### Installation + Execution

Clone the repository and import it into the Unity-Editor.
When errors occur, please clear the console and check if the packagemanager is included (Window -> Package Mangager).
If that's not the case, close the Unity-Editor and delete the file "manifest.json" in the directory packages in your project directory. 
Start the Unity-Editor again.

Now you should be able to Build and Run the software.

If you want to use the features of Simulation of Urban MObility ([SUMO](https://www.dlr.de/ts/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-9883/16931_read-41000/)), install Version 1.5. After the installation you may need to **restart** your PC.

#### Input-Configuration

````
-Vertical = Gas + Brake combined
-Horizontal = Turn left or right
-Mouse X/Y = Look around while driving
-ButtonCancel = Button for pausing the game
-ButtonReverse = Button for activating reverse
-ButtonSkipScene = Button for skipping scenario
-ButtonHandBrake = Toggle Handbrake
-ButtonRespawn = Button for respawning the car
-ButtonLight = Toggle light On or Off
-ButtonIndicatorLeft = Toggle indicator left On or Off
-ButtonIndicatorRight = Toggle indicator right On or Off
````
Set axis and buttons of Controllers the correct way.
    
You can use e.g. the XBOX controller preset which you can load at Edit/Project Settings/Input Manager/Select Preset/"Choose your fitting preset or create a new one"


#### Fixes to known issues

**Error:**  TriangleMesh::loadFromDesc: desc.isValid() failed!
			UnityEngine.MeshCollider:set_sharedMesh(Mesh)

**Fix:** Use only maps that are known to work: Geisenfeld, Muehlhausen, Oberstimm or AmpelDemo.
Other maps might not be created correctly and need adjustment by hand.

**Error:** 	Exception: execution of SimStep() was not possible
       		Traci.TraciManager+SimulationControl.SimStep () (at Assets/Scripts/SUMOConnectionScripts/TraCI/SimulationControl.cs:37)
       		SUMOConnectionScripts.SumoUnityConnection.FixedUpdate () (at Assets/Scripts/SUMOConnectionScripts/SumoUnityConnection.cs:256)

**Fix:** SUMO is not installed or configured properly.
OpenROUTS3D should run without it, but will not display any remote vehicles or traffic lights.
