### Authors

OpenROUTS3D is developed and maintained by the [Car2X Lab](https://www.thi.de/en/research/carissma/laboratories/car2x-laboratory) at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt.

It was originally developed as part of a student's project at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt
in 2017 and has been continuously improved since then.
In 2020 another student's project worked on implementing specific features and resolve performance issues of the driving simulator.
